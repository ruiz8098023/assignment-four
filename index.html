                <p>Here are the best in the world of video gaming...or at least that's what I've seen. I'm not a noob, I swear.</p>

                    <h3>Kirby</h3>
                    <p>A pink ameoba, this character can copy his opponent's abilities and use it against them. Also, he's super cute.</p>

                    <h3>Meta Knight</h3>
                    <p>Did you know the english dub selected for Meta Knight in the show "Kirby: Right Back At Ya!" was a Spanish/Transelvanian accent? Cool, right?</p>

                    <p>From Wind Waker, (another game I never played) this character has a great bow and arrow you can spam throughout the fight.</p>

                    <h2>Mario Kart Vehicles</h2>
                    <p>I've used these and won. Somehow. Maybe it's because I practiced more than the average adult, even though I don't own a Switch. Maybe it's Mabelline.</p>
                    
                    <div class="kartbox">
                        <p>I could've done a flip-card thing where each image clicked shows the kart name and stats, but I'm not that <span class="sparkle">productive</span>. So here's the run down.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Landship</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acceleration is pretty high up there with this boat on land.</li>
                            <li>Ground and Water handling is also pretty good. Because it's a boat.</li>
                            <li>Feel like a pirate of the roads.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Streetle</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An Animal Crossing original vehicle.</li>
                            <li>Acceleration is great, so you can pretend like you didn't just slip on a banana peel.</li>
                            <li>Looks like a beetle. Is light like a beetle.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Pipe Frame</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>More of an average kart, but for the guys that like that body.</li>
                            <li>Did you ever wonder what it would be like to control that old Windows screen saver?</li>
                        </ul>
